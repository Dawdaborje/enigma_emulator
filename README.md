# My Enigma Emulator

This is an emulator that recreates the famous Enigma machine - the legendary cryptography device used extensively during World War II in the 1940s.

## Inspiration

After watching _The Imitation Game_, I became fascinated by the incredible story of Alan Turing and the team at Bletchley Park who worked tirelessly to crack the Enigma code. The film beautifully showcased both the complexity of the machine and the brilliance required to break it. This project is my tribute to that remarkable achievement and a way to explore the fascinating intersection of history, mathematics, and cryptography that captivated me in the movie.

## What is the Enigma Machine?

The Enigma machine was a mechanical encryption device that scrambled messages to keep military communications secret. It was primarily used by German forces during WWII, and breaking its code was one of the most significant intelligence breakthroughs of the war.

## What You're Building

You're creating a digital recreation of this historical machine that will:

- **Simulate the original mechanics** - Three rotating wheels (rotors) that scramble letters as you type
- **Provide authentic encryption** - Use the same encoding principles as the real 1940s machine
- **Offer interactive experience** - Click buttons, adjust settings, and see letters light up just like the original
- **Demonstrate historical cryptography** - Show how encryption worked before computers

## Key Features Your Emulator Will Have

- **Rotors** - Three spinning wheels that change the encryption with each letter
- **Keyboard** - Type messages just like on the original machine
- **Lampboard** - See encoded letters light up
- **Plugboard** - Connect letter pairs for extra security (like the real machine)
- **Historical accuracy** - Based on actual Enigma specifications

## Why This Matters

This project combines history, mathematics, and programming to bring an important piece of WWII technology back to life. It's educational, technically challenging, and creates something people can actually use to understand how encryption worked in the pre-digital era.

Your emulator will let anyone experience the same encryption process that once protected top-secret military communications!
