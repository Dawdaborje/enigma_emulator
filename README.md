# My Enigma Emulator

This is an emulator that recreates the famous Enigma machine - the legendary cryptography device used extensively during World War II in the 1940s.

## What is the Enigma Machine?

The Enigma machine was a mechanical encryption device that scrambled messages to keep military communications secret. It was primarily used by German forces during WWII, and breaking its code was one of the most significant intelligence breakthroughs of the war.

## What You're Building

You're creating a digital recreation of this historical machine that will:

- **Simulate the original mechanics** - Three rotating wheels (rotors) that scramble letters as you type
- **Provide authentic encryption** - Use the same encoding principles as the real 1940s machine
- **Offer interactive experience** - Click buttons, adjust settings, and see letters light up just like the original
- **Demonstrate historical cryptography** - Show how encryption worked before computers

## Key Features Your Emulator Will Have

- **Rotors** - Three spinning wheels that change the encryption with each letter
- **Keyboard** - Type messages just like on the original machine
- **Lampboard** - See encoded letters light up
- **Plugboard** - Connect letter pairs for extra security (like the real machine)
- **Historical accuracy** - Based on actual Enigma specifications

## Why This Matters

This project combines history, mathematics, and programming to bring an important piece of WWII technology back to life. It's educational, technically challenging, and creates something people can actually use to understand how encryption worked in the pre-digital era.

Your emulator will let anyone experience the same encryption process that once protected top-secret military communications!
